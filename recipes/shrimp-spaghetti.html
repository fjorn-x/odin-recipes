    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

      <li>8 ounces uncooked whole-grain spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 pound peeled, deveined raw medium shrimp</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped leek (from 1 large leek)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic (from 3 garlic cloves)</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen baby sweet peas (about 9 oz.), thawed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>

    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1 </strong> <br />
        Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt and fat.
        Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Cover pasta to keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2 </strong> <br />
        While pasta cooks, pat shrimp dry with paper towels; season with pepper
        and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Heat half of the olive oil in a large nonstick
        skillet over high. Add shrimp; cook, stirring often, until cooked
        through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. (Do
        not wipe skillet clean.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3 </strong><br />
        Reduce heat to medium-high. Add leek, garlic, remaining oil, and
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until leek is
        slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas, cream, lemon zest, lemon
        juice, and reserved 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Reduce heat to medium;
        simmer until sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp to
        skillet; toss to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4 </strong><br />
        Divide pasta among 4 bowls; top evenly with shrimp and sauce. Sprinkle
        with dill, and serve immediately.
